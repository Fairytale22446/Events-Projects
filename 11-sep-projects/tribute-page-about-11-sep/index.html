        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1876–1948), honored as “Quaid-e-Azam,” was the
          founder of Pakistan. He was a visionary leader whose determination,
          integrity, and leadership gave Muslims of the subcontinent a separate
          homeland. His guidance shaped the destiny of millions and laid the
          foundation of Pakistan.

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Born on December 25, 1876 in Karachi, Jinnah belonged to a merchant
          family. He later moved to London for higher studies, where he trained
          as a barrister at Lincoln’s Inn. His exposure to law and politics in
          England shaped his vision and leadership qualities.

        <h2>Political Struggle</h2>
        <p>
          Jinnah began his political career with the Indian National Congress
          but later joined the All India Muslim League. He dedicated his life to
          protecting the rights of Muslims, promoting unity, and resisting
          injustices. His tireless struggle transformed the political landscape
          of the Indian subcontinent.

        <h2>Independence</h2>
        <p>
          Through Jinnah’s unmatched leadership, the dream of Pakistan became a
          reality on August 14, 1947. As the first Governor-General, he worked
          to establish strong institutions and guide the new nation. His
          principles of <em>Unity, Faith, and Discipline</em> remain a timeless
          message for every Pakistani.
